00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,259
The Curves filter in GIMP

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,679
recently got several useful improvements.

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,379
Vous aurez accès à eux

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,879
once GIMP 2.10.12 will be released,

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,300
which is soon enough.

6
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:19,320
The most visible change is the numeric input

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,120
to set coordinates of points on the curve.

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,440
It works just as expected:

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,360
click to select a point,

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
then edit its coordinates right here.

11
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:33,539
The other big change is the newly introduced

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:34,560
sharp type of points.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,100
This allows making sharp

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,899
rather than smooth transitions,

15
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:41,759
and you can combine sharp and smooth points

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,000
on a single curve

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Click to select a point,

18
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,760
then click here to select the point's type.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,160
Speaking of which,

20
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,839
now when you click to select a point on a curve,

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,960
GIMP does its best not to move it.

22
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,799
Moreover, now when you press Ctrl

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,159
while adding or dragging a point on a curve,

24
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,619
the point will snap

25
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,840
to the original segment of the curve,

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,039
and all the changes will be very slight.

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,819
This is great for cases

28
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,259
when you need to add a bunch of points to a curve

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,180
and deal with them later.

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,540
Finally, when you hover the mouse pointer

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,560
over the curve point

32
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,079
or drag that point,

33
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,780
the dialog will display the curve point's coordinates

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,120
rather than mouse pointer coordinates.

35
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,079
All in all, a bunch of very useful changes

36
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,420
that improve GIMP's user experience.
